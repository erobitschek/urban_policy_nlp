    "Based on the responses, I am seeing several things: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) The response length varies greatly, with shorter responses more often (but not always) being \"throw away\" responses that are: \n",
    ">Either somewhat random (e.g. \"Fyfgfx\" or \"Bzsbsnsbsn\") or \n",
    ">unrelated to the survey or displaying a sort of apathetic/lackadiasical attitude (or maybe they were just tired of filling out the survey at that point - hard to say haha. (e.g. \"Idk\", \"Nope\", \"Favor\", \"Nigh\", \"40\", \"I’m not yo I’m not talking to you\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the fact there are these patterns might be informative in and of themselves if they relate reliably to certain survey responses. (They also speak to core issues potentially like lack of trust or lack of knowledge, although they are confounded/hard to infer motivations behind them).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Even in substantive responses, the spelling isnt necessarily great so we should keep that in mind. \n",
    ">(e.g. \"Because it would be more far to people that don't have much\") - this person clearly meant \"fair\" not \"far\". or \"I think the 10 percent is to high of a yearly increase\" - this person clearly meant \"too\" not \"to\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3) This is going to be hard/may not pull out anything reliably interesting \n",
    "\n",
    "4) May be interesting to see if response patterns map to particular neighborhoods"
