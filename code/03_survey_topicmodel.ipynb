    "## Stage 3: Topic modelling of the pre-processed data with LDA\n",
    "To move beyond top individual words and better characterize themes themes or “topics” in the responses that don’t rely as much on a pre-stratification of the data along a particular response category, I carried out further preprocessing and topic modelling on the text data. Topic modeling is a method for unsupervised classification of documents, similar to clustering on numeric data, which finds some natural groups of items (topics). Topic modeling techniques (specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA) have been successfully applied in the context of NLP and text data to extract the main themes from the document collection without having to define them based on a priori expectations, although such methods have their limitations."

There are areas in the City of Chicago that are mostly vacant lots that should be considered for \"densification\" before coming into established neighborhoods and doing so in them to the detriment of present residents. The City of Chicago would do far better to focus on decreasing the bad policies that have been imposed for decades. It is already obvious that the City of Chicago is losing population and will continue to do so. In mandating increased density in residential neighborhoods it will only drive people out of the city. It would actually make more sense to reduce density of residential buildings, increase greenspaces, improve policing, reduce taxes and promote the livability that can be gained.\n",

I believe these buildings should be rehabbed and refitted with new appliances and wiring and then rented out affordably. There is a distinct lack of affordable housing where I live and if I weren't rent stabilized I wouldn't be able to live within 200 miles of here. The neighborhood before Covid was already very dense because there are several hospital systems in the neighborhood so more density would not work as the streets are already too crowded with autos, taxis, etc. The sidewalks are pretty crowded, too. There is also the issue of sunlight. I have lost so much sun coming into my apartment by the buildings that have been constructed around me, many by the hospital system. Streets are dark in the middle of the day around here where they used to be sunny. There is no green space around here. The mayor seems to be adding  green spaces downtown, in Brooklyn but not here for some reason. I guess there's no space as the buildings took it all up and the highway takes up the space by the river here. I would say the quality of life  has gone downhill in the last 20+ years due to overbuilding and high prices not only for rents/apartments but in the stores around here as well. So many stores have closed here during the pandemic I have to wonder how any will make a comeback. The real estate prices and taxes are off the roof here and that's a major problem, too. If I went to Brooklyn or Queens I would be paying a lot less for the same item I buy here. I have done it. I did it more when I had a car but I had to give that up because the building raised their garage rent to non-owners to a ridiculous level and there was no street parking because you compete with the hospital employees and bike lanes/racks that have taken away spaces and my freedom in a way. Is that enough for ya?\n",

The City of Chicago would do far better to focus on decreasing the bad policies that have been imposed for decades. It is already obvious that the City of Chicago is losing population and will continue to do so. In mandating increased density in residential neighborhoods it will only drive people out of the city.

I believe these buildings should be rehabbed and refitted with new appliances and wiring and then rented out affordably. There is a distinct lack of affordable housing where I live and if I weren't rent stabilized I wouldn't be able to live within 200 miles of here. The neighborhood before Covid was already very dense because there are several hospital systems in the neighborhood so more density would not work as the streets are already too crowded with autos, taxis, etc. The sidewalks are pretty crowded, too. There is also the issue of sunlight. I have lost so much sun coming into my apartment by the buildings that have been constructed around me, many by the hospital system. Streets are dark in the middle of the day around here where they used to be sunny. There is no green space around here. The mayor seems to be adding  green spaces downtown, in Brooklyn but not here for some reason. I guess there's no space as the buildings took it all up and the highway takes up the space by the river here. I would say the quality of life  has gone downhill in the last 20+ years due to overbuilding and high prices not only for rents/apartments but in the stores around here as well. So many stores have closed here during the pandemic I have to wonder how any will make a comeback. The real estate prices and taxes are off the roof here and that's a major problem, too. If I went to Brooklyn or Queens I would be paying a lot less for the same item I buy here. I have done it. I did it more when I had a car but I had to give that up because the building raised their garage rent to non-owners to a ridiculous level and there was no street parking because you compete with the hospital employees and bike lanes/racks that have taken away spaces and my freedom in a way.
