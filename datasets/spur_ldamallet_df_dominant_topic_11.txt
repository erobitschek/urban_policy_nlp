106	106	10.0	0.1729	people, live, city, lot, family, place, price, house, bad, property	I don't actually accept most of these, considering it's outrageous the rent in Chicago and there's so many abandoned lots and worthless condos that could be turned into homeless shelters considering even home owners can't pay the disgusting and unfair property tax. Chicago politicians deserve to loose long time decade old residents like my family to leave this city and never look back.

We do not get enough police protection, don't have large grocery stores, don't have enough social activities for youths based on the current residents.

I do however feel like the south side could use more entertainment stores small shops in neighborhoods so that's a plus to implement in housing projects on that side of town. I'm in favor of rent control I think that rent in Chicago is getting out of hand even in areas like mine, North Lawndale.

I think these three things are most important for sustainable neighborhood growth in Chicago.

Buildings that have small businesses in the lobby or built in are always welcome here. Inclusion zones are tricky, there are extremely problematic buildings in our neighborhood that have a large percentage of inclusionary zone residents. Rent control is important here, but not the primary issue.

Increasing density and imposing the majority of ideas stated would not be remotely beneficial. There are areas in the City of Chicago that are mostly vacant lots that should be considered for ""densification"" before coming into established neighborhoods and doing so in them to the detriment of present residents. The City of Chicago would do far better to focus on decreasing the bad policies that have been imposed for decades. It is already obvious that the City of Chicago is losing population and will continue to do so. In mandating increased density in residential neighborhoods it will only drive people out of the city. It would actually make more sense to reduce density of residential buildings, increase greenspaces, improve policing, reduce taxes and promote the livability that can be gained."

Other projects can be developed for the next tier of housing.

1437	1437	2.0	0.1372	housing, affordable, include, percentage, accept, social, emission, requirement, amount, income	It seems to be the least worse proposal. There is definitely a requirement for both housing and regeneration of the area

A larger population would mean more schools and transport and less greenery in an area of London that's unique in being so green which is important to the environment less mature trees mean less air quality new immature trees can not replace what imortant qualities ie air and environment that mature trees give us this area is low rise and would not support large high rise properties people move here for everything I've said. The property prices would plummet if this area is increased by 50-100% and we'd get problems with security and safety of residence and their property this area is seen as desirable creative literate and consists of multinational people living together mostly extremely wealthy Russians Chinese Japanese German Spanish Italian Greek people with many different religions. We have some great private schools well known schools in the area I would not want to live here and see my area devalued both in quality of environment ie both environmental and quality of neighbourhood eroded by a 50-100% increase few could afford over a million pounds for an apartment which is the average price of flats here houses 2-6 million. I'd want to move and take my money and investment out of the area that includes my business.

1726	1726	1.0	0.1282	climate, rent, important, cap, building, change, build, issue, neutral, mixed	I feel it's very important that things are taken into consideration re climate and population density also that residents have a say

1733	1733	5.0	0.1445	prefer, project, investor, profit, apartment, government, business, local, mixed_use, non_profit	I'm in favour of development as long as it's not increasing by 100% population. no foreign investment and a mixture of housing, craft shops and  seating areas
1734	1734	6.0	0.1383	community, favor, involvement, public, generally, increase, support, vote, low_income, offer	I generally was suspicious of the larger projects (e.g. 100% increase in density).  I think developments of the scale can be damaging to the fabric of communities so I would require much more information in order to support them.  I also have a preference for mixed use for the same reasons about community.
1735	1735	2.0	0.1066	housing, affordable, include, percentage, accept, social, emission, requirement, amount, income	too much housing already - deport first

1741	1741	2.0	0.1324	housing, affordable, include, percentage, accept, social, emission, requirement, amount, income	The main factor was whether there was affordable housing, rent cap and less density.

I don't think the housing crisis should be used to gain huge sums of money for private individuals. I prefer UK based projects. I do not want bars built near me. In the past we have had huge problems with anti-social behaviour linked to bars and clubs and similar establishments. I would want a say as a local person. I would want a good percentage for those with lower incomes as we are being priced out of areas we were born in and grew up in. I think climate issues are important so zero carbon projects are best. Rents are going through the roof and too many loacal businesses and home dwellers are being forced out of areas, so I think caps are good.
1747	1747	6.0	0.1217	community, favor, involvement, public, generally, increase, support, vote, low_income, offer	It is hard to gauge the true impact at this stage but it is very important to cater and provide affordable housing and the additional are incentives

1988	1988	9.0	0.1332	rent, control, factor, fair, landlord, grateful, form, key, district, maximum	More affordable is a factor that helps me decide because living in london is already expensive so a decrease in rent or affordability is a key factor

2036	2036	7.0	0.1557	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	Properties with mixed use bring in more trade in areas but can increase rents in area, so undecided on this, increasing density also can increase in trade but also more traffic and more crime there is too many anomalies to decide on

2041	2041	8.0	0.2179	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	Lower density will always win out for me, London is too crowded as it is. But there is a wider issue that is always overlooked - the wider infrastructure. You can increase living density by 20%, 50%, 100% but what about everything else locally it will impact upon? Where are the plans for increasing GP places? School places? Dentists? Transport space? THAT is where the real problem lies more often than  not. Cram more flats in but don't think about the wider infrastructure needs!
2042	2042	3.0	0.26	make, thing, development, idea, great, time, favour, densification, infrastructure, year	Goodmayes has two crossings between Goodmayes and Seven Kings station, those corssings are at capacity already during most of the morning and afternoon.  The new development at Goodmayes station will cause even more congestion to the area as well as the development in progress at the old homebase location next to Seven Kings station.  All new developments must have some common sense exercised in how the local transport and hospital infrastructure will be able to handle the increase in new tenants.  With such a high increase in tenants I believe that it would be criminal not to have affordable housing as a mandatory requirement to get a successful application.
2043	2043	7.0	0.1397	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	Mainly because of the lower percentage increase in population

2074	2074	8.0	0.2149	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	I think densification causes too much disruption to many existing areas, plonks too many people in an area, which affects existing residents' feeling of belonging, feeling of safety and security, ability to have some light, space and/or feeling of space. Also too much pressure on public transport and other amenities, and doctors, dentists and schools.

The word ""affordable"" in this context doesn't really suit. I can't judge density without knowing the site; some sites will be suitable for very dense housing, others not; further I would want to know something about social provision (schools, libraries, medical premises, clubs etc.) and shops.

Rent control has failed in the past, and would fail again - there needs to be a free market in rent (and as noted a decent amount of affordable/social housing for rent). Population density increase should not be as great as 100%, even 50% is probably too high depending on location and related infrastructure.

Also there were too few options with emphasis on green credentials and when these appeared they were unlikely to be credible considering other aspects of the proposal (eg very high densification).

2406	2406	2.0	0.1352	housing, affordable, include, percentage, accept, social, emission, requirement, amount, income	I think there should be social housing included and there should be rent control
2407	2407	2.0	0.1401	housing, affordable, include, percentage, accept, social, emission, requirement, amount, income	I dont believe there should be significant rent increases each year on affordable housing. These rents are not affordable. Social rent caps are what is really needed.

2413	2413	2.0	0.1008	housing, affordable, include, percentage, accept, social, emission, requirement, amount, income	Density and local involvement were main factors

2485	2485	2.0	0.1424	housing, affordable, include, percentage, accept, social, emission, requirement, amount, income	It doesn't really affect me much, considering my current housing situation, but I think affordable housing is necessary and I don't agree with the idea of people going homeless
2486	2486	8.0	0.1228	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	I would like mixed use with restaurants and shops to bring more life to the neighbourhood

2489	2489	9.0	0.1377	rent, control, factor, fair, landlord, grateful, form, key, district, maximum	Rent controls were the most important factor for me.
2490	2490	5.0	0.1077	prefer, project, investor, profit, apartment, government, business, local, mixed_use, non_profit	I adopted a middle of the road stance, against the criterion: 'is this reasonable.'  I am also less concerned with the fine detail than with the 'how' of the project. Implementation is as important as the strategy, and in the UK most projects succeed or fail because of how they are implemented rather the nature of the concept.
2491	2491	5.0	0.1607	prefer, project, investor, profit, apartment, government, business, local, mixed_use, non_profit	Basically I prefer such projects to be financed and completed by government/local authorities
2492	2492	3.0	0.1192	make, thing, development, idea, great, time, favour, densification, infrastructure, year	no more building full stop!! there's been too much of it over the years
2493	2493	10.0	0.1301	people, live, city, lot, family, place, price, house, bad, property	I think density is large enough as the more people we have increases traffic which is not good for everyday living 
2494	2494	8.0	0.1568	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	I'M AGAINST ANY FORM OF RENT CONTROL BECAUSE IT IS ANTI-COMPETITIVE AND IT PENALISES PRIVATE SECTOR LANDLORDS IN AN ERA OF INFLATIONARY GROWTH. I DISLIKE AND ABHORR 100% DENSIFICATION BECAUSE IT PUTS TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE, SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS AND DOCTOR'S SURGERIES AND MAKES LIFE A LOT HARDER FOR EXISTING RESIDENTS IN THE AREA.
2495	2495	2.0	0.1258	housing, affordable, include, percentage, accept, social, emission, requirement, amount, income	Rent increases should be limited to 5%.  The project should include affordable housing and a mix of apartments and commercial.
2496	2496	8.0	0.119	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	I was checking mostly the max level of rental increases 
2497	2497	3.0	0.1171	make, thing, development, idea, great, time, favour, densification, infrastructure, year	any increase needs to have an increase in infrastructure which doesnt happen
2498	2498	1.0	0.1186	climate, rent, important, cap, building, change, build, issue, neutral, mixed	I reject all proposals as they do not all include rent, density & resident control, climate neutral UK financing
2499	2499	8.0	0.1794	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	Development will happen regardless, the problem is that no provision for parking is ever adequate for the size of the development and there will never be enough charging points for all the cars that any of the proposals will create, neither will there be concessions for deliveries and the town will choke with far too many cycle lanes and petty parking restrictions along with fewer car parks. Retailing will be killed off by the councils plans even though more housing is essential.
2500	2500	3.0	0.119	make, thing, development, idea, great, time, favour, densification, infrastructure, year	not in favour of any development in existing built up areas
2501	2501	5.0	0.1263	prefer, project, investor, profit, apartment, government, business, local, mixed_use, non_profit	The housing being built in Lewisham is high rise and small aparments that are too small
2502	2502	8.0	0.154	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	The issue is not the increase in population rather what the local area can handle in terms of travel, public facilities (e.g doctors and hospitals).
2503	2503	7.0	0.1237	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	There has already been a significant density of population in this area; the proposals would only exacerbate this possibly leading to civil unrest and an increase in crime.
2504	2504	7.0	0.1129	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	concerns on density of population and mix given proximity of large mosque
2505	2505	7.0	0.1372	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	My main concern would be the increase in population density
2506	2506	9.0	0.1304	rent, control, factor, fair, landlord, grateful, form, key, district, maximum	to double density is too much and I approve of environment control and rent control
2507	2507	9.0	0.1071	rent, control, factor, fair, landlord, grateful, form, key, district, maximum	Rents capped at 5 percent seems fair and there should also be restaurants and businesses to create community
2508	2508	7.0	0.1195	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	Keep density low
2509	2509	7.0	0.1627	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	Rent control to an extent is ok with me; Slight increase in population density is acceptable for me;
2510	2510	5.0	0.155	prefer, project, investor, profit, apartment, government, business, local, mixed_use, non_profit	Local input is imperative along with affordable housing handled by local government
2511	2511	7.0	0.117	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	No rent control' is a no-go area for me, so also is a population of over 50 percent
2512	2512	0.0	0.1087	good, neighborhood, feel, work, choice, reason, depend, pick, safe, rate	no reason in particular
2513	2513	8.0	0.119	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	Neither option in any of the selections was suitable in an already over-populated area
2514	2514	7.0	0.1235	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	do not want local density increased by 100%
2515	2515	5.0	0.1383	prefer, project, investor, profit, apartment, government, business, local, mixed_use, non_profit	Density here is already enough. But if there is to be an increase, affordable housing is vital, and profiteering by developers is already something of a scandal so government or non-profit developers should be used.
2516	2516	5.0	0.1448	prefer, project, investor, profit, apartment, government, business, local, mixed_use, non_profit	I feel that there should be climate requirements and affordable housing in all projects and prefer not-for-profit developers

2518	2518	0.0	0.1046	good, neighborhood, feel, work, choice, reason, depend, pick, safe, rate	Best for local residents
2519	2519	8.0	0.1212	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	Some rules can be twisted but a general law is better
2520	2520	8.0	0.1432	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	Population density increase in an already crowded area will cause major issues in the future from the perspective of traffic, pollution, crime 
2521	2521	7.0	0.1148	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	Cheaper longterm rent is essential and less population density is required.
2522	2522	3.0	0.1328	make, thing, development, idea, great, time, favour, densification, infrastructure, year	I don't like any of them. They will all lead to overcrowding. The infrastructure of the area is not adequate to accommodate ANY such proposals. 
2523	2523	2.0	0.119	housing, affordable, include, percentage, accept, social, emission, requirement, amount, income	I would not support any affordable housing in my already built up area

2529	2529	3.0	0.1502	make, thing, development, idea, great, time, favour, densification, infrastructure, year	I don't like high density developments whether they be detached houses or apartments full stop. Nobody is prepared yet to confront the elephant in the room which is that there are just too many humans on the planet. We need to have a policy which encourages people to have fewer children.
2530	2530	4.0	0.1304	resident, decide, choose, option, benefit, decision, opinion, agree, base, involve	IT IS A BALANCE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. SOME OF THEM HAD LITTLE SOCIAL BENEFIT, BUT MAJOR PROFIT MOTIVE
2531	2531	7.0	0.1372	increase, density, population, low, percent, reduce, acceptable, double, oppose, reject	Increasing population density by 50% or more is a non runner. We have as many people as we can take already.

2537	2537	5.0	0.1109	prefer, project, investor, profit, apartment, government, business, local, mixed_use, non_profit	I decided against all proposals that doubled the density. I then looked at climate specifications and then who the investor was and the mix of property types
2538	2538	9.0	0.1358	rent, control, factor, fair, landlord, grateful, form, key, district, maximum	We need rent control but to bring rents down not have a maximum percaentage percentage increase 
2539	2539	9.0	0.1246	rent, control, factor, fair, landlord, grateful, form, key, district, maximum	is very good to have rent control because of people who can not afford higher rent
2540	2540	1.0	0.1109	climate, rent, important, cap, building, change, build, issue, neutral, mixed	There should be no rent cap

2544	2544	5.0	0.1212	prefer, project, investor, profit, apartment, government, business, local, mixed_use, non_profit	I think that we should be looking at less for-profit investment like most European countries 
2545	2545	3.0	0.1235	make, thing, development, idea, great, time, favour, densification, infrastructure, year	The cost doesn't make any sense

I generally agree that apartment buildings should be mix use for small businesses attached to them. Zero net use of emissions to a fantastic idea and should be implemented. Affordable housing for section 8 individuals needs to be at least 20% or more to fix the homeless situation in LA.

It will make Los Angeles into New York and if I wanted to live in NYC I'd move there. We're changing the charm of Los Angeles and slowly losing the beauty we have here. If people can't afford to live here they can live in the outskirts or move to the Midwest where they need more population.

Low income households are being squeezed out by ""gentrification"".  Even if new development includes low income housing, it is NOT ENOUGH.  Too many people are being displaced by the new luxury buildings popping up everywhere.

4539	4539	8.0	0.3419	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	"1. There are a lot of unused buildings sitting idle because they are being ""warehoused"", waiting for a buyer or a demolition. These are typically old tenement buildings. I believe these buildings should be rehabbed and refitted with new appliances and wiring and then rented out affordably. There is a distinct lack of affordable housing where I live and if I weren't rent stabilized I wouldn't be able to live within 200 miles of here. The neighborhood before Covid was already very dense because there are several hospital systems in the neighborhood so more density would not work as the streets are already too crowded with autos, taxis, etc. The sidewalks are pretty crowded, too. There is also the issue of sunlight. I have lost so much sun coming into my apartment by the buildings that have been constructed around me, many by the hospital system. Streets are dark in the middle of the day around here where they used to be sunny. There is no green space around here. The mayor seems to be adding  green spaces downtown, in Brooklyn but not here for some reason. I guess there's no space as the buildings took it all up and the highway takes up the space by the river here. I would say the quality of life  has gone downhill in the last 20+ years due to overbuilding and high prices not only for rents/apartments but in the stores around here as well. So many stores have closed here during the pandemic I have to wonder how any will make a comeback. The real estate prices and taxes are off the roof here and that's a major problem, too. If I went to Brooklyn or Queens I would be paying a lot less for the same item I buy here. I have done it. I did it more when I had a car but I had to give that up because the building raised their garage rent to non-owners to a ridiculous level and there was no street parking because you compete with the hospital employees and bike lanes/racks that have taken away spaces and my freedom in a way. Is that enough for ya?"

4713	4713	8.0	0.2103	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	This neighborhood is sufficiently dense as is. Parking is at a premium, and the city keeps doing things that take away parking and make driving more difficult and time consuming. Any additional density without addressing these problems (which our current mayor is not likely to do as he thinks no one should drive but him) would result in a decline in the quality of life in this neighborhood for the current residents, and the increased likelihood that those who could afford to do so, would consider leaving the community. That would negatively impact the community as a whole.

4718	4718	8.0	0.1526	area, high, environment, cost, pay, life, problem, space, quality, crime	High density results in more crime, congestion, parking, etc. People are too cramped in apartment style buildings as it is. Many are leaving the New York area. I'm considering the same!

Even if they said it was climate neutral or that they would make room for local businesses, in the end we would just have another bank or drug store and a bunch of empty apartments used for investment or worse, a bunch of trust fund families who leave as soon as their kids are old enough. they proudly buy 718 onesies for their infants but have no connection with Brooklyn at all. And they price the local merchants out of business.

I want to travel however even though it is generally not a safe area the establishments make me feel at home and I support this community to its betterment. I would like to see it flourish.

IF THERE WAS NO RENT CONTROL POLICY  OR IF THEY COULD INCREASE THE RENT AT LEAST 10 PERCENT A YEAR I WOULD BE AGAINST THE PROJECT. ALSO IF THERE WERE NO ALLOCATION FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS AND NO COMMUNITY IONVOLVEMENT IN THE PLANNING I REJECTED  THE PROJECT.
